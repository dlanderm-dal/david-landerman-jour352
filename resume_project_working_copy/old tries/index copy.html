                        pitches to management. These pitch decks were vigorously researched from hundreds of pages of 
                        shareholder materials and other approved statements from management to synthesize cohesive arguments 
                        for concrete action to lobby in support of the SEC's campaign to end subjective climate disclosures 
                        and the false-advertising of sustainable investment funds, a practice known as greenwashing.<br><br>
                        I also researched and advocated for more investment transparency and better health insurance benefits.

                        I worked as an R & D Co-op on the Knee Repair team at Smith & Nephew. My primary project revolved 
                        around the design of a special new drill that facilitates knee ligament reconstruction (i.e. ACL, 
                        PCL, small size meniscal root repairs, etc.). As part of a cross functional team, I generated new 
                        parts and assemblies, iterated upon them, worked with machinists to produce prototypes, and tested 
                        those prototypes. In addition to these efforts, in order to streamline snapfit design and spring 
                        selection, I created semi-automated Microsoft Excel spreadsheets which calculated relevant properties 
                        and values and assisted in utilization of these components. This was accomplished using numerous logic 
                        commands, mathematical models, and Excel's VBA editor. While on this co-op, I gained experience in test 
                        protocol and technical report drafting, as well as executing the tests themselves.

                                The three years between graduating from Northeastern and landing my first full-time 
                                engineering job I deliberately refused to apply to industries which employ large numbers 
                                of entry level mechanical engineers that conflict with my personal and professional ethics.

                                Engineers Without Borders, I supported myself as a restaurant server, a busser, a food-runner, 
                                an academic coach, and a math tutor.

                                Employed with a full-time engineering position in San Diego, I found myself unhappy with 
                                where my effort was going day-to-day. In my spare time, I took on projects that had nothing 
                                to do with engineering with large research and communication components. I was way more 
                                productive and happy working on these projects than my job's actual duties.

                                It took 3 years, plenty of soul searching, and much planning, which led me to move back to 
                                the east coast and begin a Journalism program with no prior experience in the humanties.

                                Coming from a completely different discipline means I was trained in a methodology of 
                                problem solving uncommon to life-long journalists. I learned among other things calculus, 
                                fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, measurement science, and control systems. Whether I held 
                                onto the salient details of those courses or would even use the Thermal Resistance Circuits 
                                model in my day-to-day life is immaterial. The point is that all those things both taught 
                                me how to learn and form the basis for how I approach challenges today.

                                Throughout school I learned the basics of <strong>Ruby, Python, C, VBA and Matlab.</strong> 
                                Despite the fact that today I can't write in any of those languages, learning them taught me 
                                to be deliberate and methodical with coding, which has proven to be a solid underground foundation 
                                on which to begin learning <strong>R, HTML, and CSS.</strong>

                                Once you've been a Pedicab tour guide, dependent on tips, you develop people skills. For

                                the day in the DC summer humidity. I've further developed those skills working in restaurants. 
                                As far as exposure to people in different fields, I've been a bike mechanic, academic coach, 
                                camp counselor, construction worker, and pseudo assistant school teacher on zoom.

                                My last engineering position was at a company with a complex organizational structure and 
                                occasionally a lot of siloed expertise and resources. The ease with which I cultivated 
                                relationships became uniquely useful for quickly solving problems for my team by finding
